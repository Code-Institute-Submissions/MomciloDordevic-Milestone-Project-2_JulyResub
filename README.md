## Testing 


### Functionality Testing 

I used Mozilla web developer tools and Chrome developer tools throughout the project for
testing and solving problems with responsiveness and style issues.

All links were tested multiple times during the development process to ensure that all pages were linked correctly.

Family members and friends were asked to view the site and play the game.


### Compatibility Testing

Site was tested across multiple virtual mobile devices and browsers. I checked all supported 
devices in both Mozilla web developer tolls and Chrome developer tools.

I tested on hardware devices such as: Iphone 11, Lenovo Tablet, Huawei p30 pro, Macbook Pro 15'.


## Performace Testing

I used the Lighthouse tool to check performance of the website. I had to do couple of changes to improve performance.
Screenshots are presented below:

## User Stories testing :

### As a new user :

* As a first time user, I want to challenge my memory abilities.
   * Everytime the game is reset or the page is reloaded the cards are shuffled in different places making each game different from the last.

* As first time user, I want to navigate the website easily.
   * The navigation bar allows the user to intuitively and easily move between the various pages.

* As a first time user, I want to be able to play the game on all device types.
    * The site has been developed to be easily accessible on all device types.

### As a returning user : 
    
* As a returning user, I would like to get in contact with the games creator for further games or potential colaboration and info on development.

   * Returning users can find a link to my Social Media (Instagram) where they can contact me about any further information and questions they might have, and there is a link to my github repositories in case a user is interested in working together in a future colaboration or if the user has questions about how the game was made or how it functions. They can aswell ask questions on how the game works possibly even though its pretty self explanatory.


* As a returning user, I would like to test out my skills in the game to their full potential.

   * Returning users have the information on how many sets of cards have been flipped every time they finish the game, so they can try out themselves in completing the game with the least ammount of card sets flipped.


### As a website owner

* I want my visitors to be able to navigate my website intuitively and easily.

   * The game page has a navigation bar located at the top of the page that can take you back to the starting page.

* I would like the game to be fun and enthralling for visitors.
   * The cards are pictures of various dog breeds. Everytime the game is reset the cards are in different places making each  game different from the last.

* I would like to build and maintain relationship with potential and current visitors.

   * Users can contact me via social links, as well as having a link to my github repositories for potential future colaborations.


## Deployment

The project was deployed on GitHub Pages. I used Gitpod as a development environment where I commited all changes to git version control system. I used push command in Gitpod to save changes into GitHub.

To deploy a project I had to:

 * Log in to GitHub and click on repository to deploy (Milestone-Project-2).

 * Select Settings and find GitHub Pages section at the very bottom of the page.
 
 * From source select none and then Milestone-Projects branch.
 
 * Click save and page was deployed after auto-refresh.

To run localy:

 * Log in to GitHub and click on repository to download (Milestone-Project-2).

## Bugs during development

* Had an issue with the flip counter span, it stoped working as soon as i added another span that shows the same information when the game has been completed.

* Had an issue with Audio files, both the audio file for a match and for a game victory played at the same time when the game is completed and resulted in a victory.

## Credits

 * To complete this project I used Code Institute many various tasks and early projects that
 i encountered during my studies, the slack community was so helpful and its a great thing
 to have help you when you run into problems that you alone cannot solve, to help me create
 the memory game javascript itself, I watched several youtube videos and channels that point
 out certain things that changed my code into what i needed to be.

 * W3schools.com was used for explanations and clarity on issues with sizing and other visual effects.

 * Web Development Simplified, a youtube channel with great instructional videos on a lot of topics covering Web Development.

 * Ideas and knowledge library:

    * w3schools.com

    * css-tricks.com

    * youtube.com

    * leetcode.com

    * stackoverflow.com

## Acknowledgements

* My mentor for support, advice and feedback on how to get my project to where it is now.

* The students on Slack for endless information on various questions.

* My family for their endless support, feedback and testing.
